CRUE introduces an Intra-modality Relation Exploration module (IRE) and a novel Uncertainty-guided Modeling module (UGM). IRE is specifically designed to smooth hard-matching relations by modeling intra-modality similarity. UGM is specifically designed to handle weak and noise-matched image-text pairs by modeling features as distributions. Both the IRE and UGM modules effectively consider genuine intra-modality similarities and reduce the negative impact of uncertainties.\
